Other Tools:

Git for version control

NPM/Yarn for package management

(Please note: The exact technologies will depend on the implementation within the repository. You may need to update this section after reviewing the code.)

Setup and Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (or your chosen backend runtime)

NPM or Yarn

A database system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DipaliVala/Cosmetics.git
cd Cosmetics

Install frontend dependencies:

# If using npm
npm install
# If using yarn
yarn install

Install backend dependencies:

# Navigate to your backend directory if it's separate (e.g., `cd server`)
# If using npm
npm install
# If using yarn
yarn install

Database Setup:

Create a database (e.g., cosmetics_db).

Update the database connection string in your backend configuration file (e.g., .env file).

Run database migrations/seeders if provided.

Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root of your backend directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database URI, API keys, JWT secret).

DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
PORT=5000
# Add other necessary variables like JWT_SECRET, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY etc.

Usage
Running the Development Server
Start the backend server:

# Navigate to your backend directory if separate
npm start # or `node server.js` or `python app.py` etc.

Start the frontend development server:

# Navigate to your frontend directory if separate
npm start # or `yarn start`

Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port your frontend is running on).
